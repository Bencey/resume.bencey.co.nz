    Linking Github and Patreon together
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    On the 11/27/2019 I created a discord bot which integrated patreon and github together. The client that I was working for requested a bot which when a patreon sent a message in a discord channel it would invite them to the private github repository. I managed to create this by linking the two APIs together so if a user was a patreon it allowed them to send a specific command which asked the user for their github username, Once their username was sent it would automatically send them an invitation. I also had to make it so when a user was no longer a patreon it would remove them from the repository
