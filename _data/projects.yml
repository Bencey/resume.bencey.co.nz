    A multipurpose Discord Bot
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This bot is programmed in discordjs (A nodejs module branched from java script) The bot was connected to a database which allowed persistant data for example each server had their own unique settings which allowed admins to choose how users were greeted when they joined the server, What channel the server logs would be sent to and other small settings. The Bot also had a dashboard which allowed users to visit the dashboard on any browser and was able to view the Member list, Scoreboard, Settings, Command list and more. This bot is no longer maintained but I have plans on bringing it back

    Linking DIscord and Telegram together
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Created a chat bridge for CodPool which linked their telegram and discord servers together. This bot uses the API Of Discord And Telegram so if a user was to talk in a specific discord channel it would send the message to telegram, and if a message was sent in telegram it would send it to that specific discord channel. This allows users from each platform to communicate with each other without having to install another program on their computer. If a message was deleted on discord it would also delete it from the telegram which made it easier for Moderators to do their job

    Linking Github and Patreon together
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    On the 11/27/2019 I created a discord bot which integrated patreon and github together. The client that I was working for requested a bot which when a patreon sent a message in a discord channel it would invite them to the private github repository. I managed to create this by linking the two APIs together so if a user was a patreon it allowed them to send a specific command which asked the user for their github username, Once their username was sent it would automatically send them an invitation. I also had to make it so when a user was no longer a patreon it would remove them from the repository

    A Crypto Discord Bot
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I recently created software for a cryptocurrency coin (2ACoin). This allowed users to  send each other crypto currency via discord. The program used BlockChain API And Discord API. When the user first joined for the first time they need to register their wallet using the program and then their username and wallet address will be saved in a database. If someone was to send that user coins it would pull the wallet address from the database send the coins and then subtract the coins from the senders wallet.

  name: Twitch Discord Bot
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I Made a discord bot that would connect to the Twitch API and would alert users that are in a discord server that the user is streaming (Would also say what the stream title is and what game they are playing). I made this bot using discord.js and the bot was requested to be made by a client. Also when a message was sent in the twitch chat it would post it to discord and when a message was posted in discord it would be posted to the twitch chat.

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I have recently created and designed a website for Evolution Roleplay. This website contained important server information, links and contained a gallery. The gallery had a dynamic photo system so when a photo was added to a folder it would add it to the website. Underneath the photo it would contain the photo name this was done by php retrieving the filename and removing the file extension it then posted the filename under the image.
