    Currently a student at a university (College for me) somewhere in New Zealand which I am not going to reveal the name of. I am currently a year 12 student and will be completing my school education at the end of 2020

    I am currently involved in many clubs within the school one of the groups I am is the Leos Club, This club is dedicated towards community service and helping the community. We meet weekly and discuss what we can do to contribute to the community / School. Another group I am involved in is the Audio Visual Group. I am one of the senior AV Techs and I am in charge of making sure that events have sound setup such as prize givings, assemblies and sports events. I help teach the new members how to setup these events and divide the work between us all
