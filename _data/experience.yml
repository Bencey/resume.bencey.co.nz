This person is such an inspiration to me and without him I would not be where I am right now (Blogging) he is the person who helped me get started on blogging after buying me the domain I currently use. Some of my roles in his server is to set it up Such as finding bots that suit his needs and deal with permissions and channels.

    For a year I was a discord Administrator for a discord server called DistrictPvP. unfortunately my time came to an end when the Owner decided to delete the discord server as he wanted to merge his two servers together (Gotpvp + Districtpvp) Some of my roles on the network were less aimed at chat but to train + promote discord staff Such as helpers and moderators to make sure that they were suited for the position and have the tools needed to help keep the community safe
