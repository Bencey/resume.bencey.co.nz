    I have been helping someone I know in real life to setup his discord server. This person is such an inspiration to me and without him I would not be where I am right now (Blogging) he is the person who helped me get started on blogging after buying me the domain I currently use. Some of my roles in his server is to set it up Such as finding bots that suit his needs and deal with permissions and channels.
