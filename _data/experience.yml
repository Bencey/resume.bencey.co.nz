   I was a developer for a FiveM Community, The server is a roleplaying community based around the game Fivem (Roleplaying version of Gta). Majority of our scripts are coded in Lua and I was one of the members of the small team that are focused on keeping the server maintained and adding new features. Some of my jobs I was tasked with were creating an anticheat for the server as they had issues with exploiters in the past. I also applied bug fixes to scripts when we were notified of a bug.
